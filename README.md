The latest in a long line of great ideas waiting to be executed.

### Concept:  
Single or multi player, move around a large vehicle.  Vehicle must be powered, or could use more eco friendly options to move.  similar to FAR: lone sails, but as a open world sand box.  The vehicle would be selectivly upgradable with sections allowing free placement of blocks.  Leaving the vehicle would be dangerous.  The world would be randomly generated with resources and lootable locations.  There would be rouge-like random encounters.  Upgrades to the vehicle would be things like speed, guns, boiler efficency, sails, generators, armor, insulation, refiners/smelter/crafters (automate all the things :P).  There is a top down map that you use to choose your destination but traveling is done from left to right.  the main view is of a cut away view inside your ship.

### Game cycle:
- Select travel location on map.  
- Power up ship and start moving.  
- Man bridge to watch for trouble.  
- Deal with trouble if it arrises. (random encounters/feeding the boiler)  
- Arrive at location  
- Explore location for loot. (side view platforming)  
- Return to ship  
- Use loot to build/buy upgrades  
- It takes time for upgrades to be built and time to refine resources  
- Repeat
