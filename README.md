Game idea I had.  Conccept: Single or multi player, move around a large vehicle.  Vehicle must be powered, or could use more eco friendly options to move.  similar to FAR: lone sails, but as a open world sand box.  The vehicle would be selectivly upgradable with sections allowing free placement of blocks.  Leaving the vehicle would be dangerous.
